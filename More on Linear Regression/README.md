### **1. Assumptions of Linear Regression**
Linear regression comes with several **assumptions** that are essential for it to work properly:
   - **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable must be linear.
   - **Independence**: The residuals (errors) should be independent.
   - **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals should have constant variance (no pattern in the residuals).
   - **Normality**: The residuals should be normally distributed.

Verifying these assumptions is crucial to ensure that the model is valid.

### **2. Overfitting and Underfitting**
   - **Overfitting**: This occurs when the model fits the training data too well, capturing noise rather than the underlying trend, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.
   - **Underfitting**: This happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying data structure.

   **Regularization techniques** like **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression** are commonly used to address overfitting in linear regression.

### **3. Regularization Techniques**
   - **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**: Adds a penalty term to the loss function, which shrinks the coefficients, discouraging them from growing too large. This helps mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting.

     where $\lambda$  is the regularization parameter.

   - **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Similar to Ridge but uses the absolute value of the coefficients, which can drive some of the coefficients to zero. This is useful for feature selection.

### **4. Feature Selection and Transformation**
   - **Feature Selection**: Choosing the right features is crucial for building effective models. Techniques like **Forward Selection**, **Backward Elimination**, and **Stepwise Selection** can help identify the most significant features.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Sometimes, you might want to transform or create new features to improve the model’s performance. This includes scaling, polynomial features, interaction terms, etc.

### **5. Multicollinearity**
   - **Multicollinearity** occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.
   - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** can be used to detect multicollinearity.

### **6. Evaluation Metrics**
You might want to evaluate the model’s performance using metrics:
   - **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures how well the model explains the variation in the data. 
   - **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing the error in the same units as the dependent variable.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute errors, which is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

### **7. Multivariate Linear Regression**
You’ve covered **multiple linear regression** for \( n \) independent variables, but the techniques can be extended to multiple dependent variables. This is known as **Multivariate Linear Regression** where you have a vector of dependent variables.

### **8. Diagnostics and Residual Analysis**
   - **Residual Plots**: Analyze the residuals (errors) to check if they meet the assumptions of linear regression.
   - **Influence Diagnostics**: Identify influential points using **Cook's Distance**, which helps identify data points that disproportionately affect the regression model.

### **9. Gradient Descent and Optimization**
   - **Gradient Descent**: While the closed-form solution  B = (X<sup>T</sup> X)<sup>-1</sup> X<sup>T</sup>Y works well for smaller datasets, for large datasets or when \( X^T X \) is not invertible, you can use **gradient descent** for optimization. It's an iterative approach to minimize the cost function by adjusting the weights in the direction of the gradient.
