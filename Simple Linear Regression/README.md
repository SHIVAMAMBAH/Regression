The relationship between independent variable and dependent variable is assumed to be linear:
<div align="center">y = mx + c</div>

where *m* is the slope and *c* is the intercept.<br>
The goal of the simple linear regression is to find the best-fit values of *m* and *c* that minimizes the error.
### Error Minimization (Least Squares)
To fit the line, we minimizes the **sum of the squared errors (SSE)**:
