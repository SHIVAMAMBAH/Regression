# <div align = "center">Regression Analysis</div>
**`Definition`** : Regression Analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (outcome or response variable, or label in ML) and one ot more error-free indpendent variables (regressors, predictors, covariates, explanatory variables or features).
> Error-free Independent variables refer to the assumption that the predictor variables are measured without any errors or inaccuries. They are *Accurate*, *Precise* and *Reliable*.

> This assumption is important in regression because it allows us to focus on the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, without worrying about the effects of the measurements errors or other sources of variability in the independent variables.

>In `Traditional Regression Analysis`, there is typically `only one dependent variable`. However, there are some extensions of traditional regression analysis for `multiple dependent variables` or outputs. These include : `Multivariate regression`, `Multitasking learning`, `vector-valued regression`.
## <div align = "center">Classification of Regression Analysis</div>
Regression Analysis can be classified into different types based on various factors.
