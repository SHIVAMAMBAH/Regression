# <div align = "center">Regression Analysis</div>
**`Definition`** : Regression Analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (outcome or response variable, or label in ML) and one ot more error-free indpendent variables (regressors, predictors, covariates, explanatory variables or features).
> Error-free Independent variables refer to the assumption that the predictor variables are measured without any errors or inaccuries. They are *Accurate*, *Precise* and *Reliable*.

> This assumption is important in regression because it allows us to focus on the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, without worrying about the effects of the measurements errors or other sources of variability in the independent variables.

>In `Traditional Regression Analysis`, there is typically `only one dependent variable`. However, there are some extensions of traditional regression analysis for `multiple dependent variables` or outputs. These include : `Multivariate regression`, `Multitasking learning`, `vector-valued regression`.
## <div align = "center">Classification of Regression Analysis</div>
Regression Analysis can be classified into different types based on various factors.
### Based on the type of the dependent variable
- **Simple Linear Regression** : This type of regression analysis involves a `single dependent variable` and a `single independent variable`.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** : This type of regression analysis involves a `single dependent variable` and `multiple independent variable`.
- **Logistic Regression** : This type of regression analysis involves a `binary dependent variable` and `one or more independent variables`.
- **Poisson Regression** : This type of regression analysis involves a `count dependent variable` and `one or more independent variable`.
- **Multivariate Regression** : This type of regression analysis `multiple dependent variables` and `one or more independent variables`.

### Based on the type of the Independent variable
- **Simple Linear Regression** : This type of regression involves a `single independent variable` that is `continuous`.
- **Polynomial Regression** : This type of regression involves a `single independent variable` that is continuous but the `relationship` between independent and dependent variable is `non-linear`.
